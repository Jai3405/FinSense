# Streamlit Dashboard - TODO

## Status: Removed (Broken)

The old InterDay dashboard (app.py) was incomplete and broken (cut off at line 150).

Moved to: `InterDay_OLD_BROKEN/`

## Rebuild Later (After Core Validation)

Once the training and evaluation systems are validated, we can rebuild a proper dashboard with:

### Features to Include:
- Real-time model performance
- Live trading recommendations
- Portfolio visualization
- Backtest results
- Model comparison
- TensorBoard metrics display

### Technologies:
- Streamlit (UI framework)
- Plotly (interactive charts)
- Integration with evaluate.py
- Load models from models/

## Priority: LOW (Week 3+)

Focus on core functionality first:
1. ✅ Training system
2. ⏳ Evaluation system
3. ⏳ Full experiments
4. ⏳ Validation
5. Then: Dashboard

## Estimated Effort: 1-2 days

**Note:** TensorBoard provides real-time training visualization for now.
Dashboard is nice-to-have, not critical for SPIKE features.
