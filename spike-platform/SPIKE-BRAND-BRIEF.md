# SPIKE — Brand & Design Brief

## What is SPIKE?

**SPIKE is India's first AI wealth intelligence platform.**

It's not another stock trading app. It's not a brokerage. SPIKE is the intelligence layer that sits between investors and the market — watching, analyzing, and surfacing what matters.

Think of it as having a team of world-class analysts, quant researchers, and legendary investors — all working for you, 24/7, powered by AI.

### The Name

"SPIKE" comes from the market spike — that decisive moment when something breaks out. Every major wealth creation event in the stock market begins with a spike. We help you see it before everyone else.

### The Problem

Indian retail investors are:
- Drowning in noise (100+ financial YouTube channels, Twitter "experts", WhatsApp tips)
- Using fragmented tools (one app for screener, another for charts, another for news)
- Making emotional decisions without data-backed conviction
- Missing institutional-grade intelligence that was only available to HNIs and fund houses

### The Solution

SPIKE brings everything into one intelligent surface:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Your personal command center — portfolio, watchlist, market pulse, AI insights — all at a glance |
| **Discover** | AI-curated market signals, trending stocks, sector rotations — what's moving and why |
| **FinScore** | Our proprietary 0-100 scoring system for any stock. Combines fundamentals, technicals, sentiment, and momentum into one number |
| **Portfolio** | Deep portfolio analytics — sector allocation, risk exposure, concentration analysis, rebalancing suggestions |
| **Themes** | Invest in ideas, not just tickers. EV revolution, AI boom, Green energy, Digital India — thematic baskets curated by AI |
| **Screener** | The most powerful stock screener in India. 200+ filters, natural language queries ("show me profitable midcaps under PE 20 with rising margins") |
| **Charts** | Professional-grade charting with AI-powered pattern recognition and indicator suggestions |
| **Strategy-GPT** | Chat with an AI that understands Indian markets. Ask it anything — from "should I buy Reliance?" to "build me a momentum portfolio under 5L" |
| **Legend Agents** | AI agents modeled after legendary investors — Warren Buffett, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Peter Lynch, Cathie Wood. Ask them what they'd do with your portfolio |
| **Autopilot** | Set your goals and risk tolerance. SPIKE's AI manages your portfolio autonomously — rebalancing, harvesting, protecting. You sleep, it works |

### Who Is It For?

- **Primary**: Indian retail investors (25-45 years) who are beyond beginner stage but don't have institutional tools
- **Secondary**: Young professionals (22-30) just starting their wealth journey who want smart guidance
- **Tertiary**: HNIs who want AI-augmented analysis alongside their existing advisory

### Market Context

- India has 13+ crore demat accounts (and growing fast)
- Zerodha proved Indians want clean, no-nonsense fintech
- Groww proved the young demographic wants accessible investing
- **SPIKE fills the next gap**: intelligence and AI on top of the trading infrastructure

### Competitive Positioning

| | Zerodha | Groww | Smallcase | **SPIKE** |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Trading | Yes | Yes | Via broker | No (analytics only*) |

| Screener | Basic | No | No | **Advanced + NLP** |
| Portfolio Analytics | Basic | Basic | Thematic | **Deep AI-driven** |

## Brand Identity

### Brand Personality

- **Intelligent** — Not flashy. Quietly brilliant. Like a senior analyst who speaks only when they have something worth saying
- **Trustworthy** — Dealing with people's money. Every pixel should feel safe and dependable
- **Premium but Accessible** — Not elitist. Think "quiet luxury" — high quality without showing off
- **Indian at heart** — Built for Indian markets, Indian investors, Indian context. Not a US clone
- **Forward-looking** — AI-native, not AI-bolted-on. The product breathes intelligence

### Brand Voice

- Confident, not arrogant
- Clear, not dumbed down
- Helpful, not hand-holdy
- Data-driven, not opinionated
- Calm authority (not "TO THE MOON!!!")

### Logo — The Sentinel S

The SPIKE logo is an abstract "S" mark formed by two interlocking curves:

- **Upper curve**: Sweeps from upper-right, arcs left, tapers toward center
- **Lower curve**: Sweeps from lower-left, arcs right, tapers toward center
- **Central aperture**: Where the curves create negative space — a glowing "eye"

**Symbolism:**
- The two curves = the market's duality (risk/reward, fear/greed, bull/bear)
- The central eye = the AI sentinel that never stops watching
- The S-shape = SPIKE's initial, and the organic flow of market cycles
- The curves also echo a pulse waveform — the "spike" moment of breakout

**Technical details:**
- Dark premium teal background (`#071F1C` to `#0D4A42`)
- Upper curve gradient: `#A8E6CF` → `#7DCEA0` → `#4BA89A`
- Lower curve gradient: `#89D4B8` → `#5FBAA8` → `#3D9688`
- Central glow: `#D3E9D7` (soft white-green)
- Corner radius: 112/512 (~22%)
- Edge highlights for depth and dimension

**Wordmark:**
- Font: Playfair Display (serif)
- Weight: 600 (semibold)
- Case: lowercase ("spike")
- Tracking: tight
- Color: `#00897B` (primary accent teal)

## Design Principles

1. **Data density without clutter** — Show a lot, but never overwhelm. Whitespace is a feature.
2. **Hierarchy through color, not size** — Use the text color scale (primary → secondary → muted) to guide attention.
3. **Quiet confidence** — No gradients on cards, no drop shadows everywhere, no "look at me" UI. Let the content speak.
4. **Consistent surfaces** — White cards on mint background. Always. No random grays or off-whites.
5. **Motion with purpose** — 300ms transitions. Things slide, fade, scale — never teleport. But never animate for the sake of it.
6. **Mint, not green** — The palette leans mint/teal, not forest green. It should feel fresh and modern, not institutional.

## Key Screens to Design

1. **Dashboard** — The home screen. Portfolio summary + market overview + watchlist + AI insights. This IS the product's first impression.
2. **Sidebar** — Collapsible (264px → 72px). Has nav, portfolio widget, market status. This is always visible.
3. **FinScore page** — The hero feature. A stock gets scored 0-100. This needs to feel premium and data-rich.
4. **Strategy-GPT** — Chat interface for AI. Should feel like talking to a genius analyst, not a chatbot.
5. **Autopilot** — The "set it and forget it" screen. Needs to convey trust and control simultaneously.
